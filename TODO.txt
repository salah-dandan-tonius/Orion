- Upon first run, it should:
    - Check if the file corresponding to the current strftime exists
    - It it does, check if its a valid pcap file, log, and create a new file
    - If not, resume recording

- Collection will only resume until the end of the actual hour, not 1hr after being ran
- Every specified interval of time, statistics will be collected and logged (IO, errors, etc)
- There is a flag to serve the log file on http for monitoring without interference
- There is a flag to control the snapshot length
- There is a flag to decide whether or not the output is piped to gzip (it is by default)
