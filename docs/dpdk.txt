- Hugepage support is required, which can be configured at runtime
  with dpdk-hugepages.py . It is recommended to use 1GB hugepages
  if possible.
  
- It is recommended that vfio-pci be used as the kernel module for
  DPDK-bound ports in all cases. If an IOMMU is unavailable, the
  vfio-pci can be used in no-iommu mode. Device binding and unbinding
  can be used with dpdk-devbind.py . To bind a device to vfio-pci, you
  can do: "dpdk-devbind.py --bind=vfio-pci <iface>|<pci_addr> . To make
  use of the VFIO, vfio-pci module must be loaded with "modprobe vfio-pci".
  In most cases, specifying "iommu=on" as a kernel parameter should be
  enough.

- Before running a sample application, make sure:
  - Hugepages setup is done
  - Any kernel driver being used is loaded
  - Ports being used should be bound to the corresponding kernel driver

- All sample applications share the same EAL parameters
  - https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_eal_parameters.html
  
- librte_pdump allows users to initialize the packet capture framework
  and enable or disable packet capture. librte_pcapng provides the API
  to format packets and write them to a file in pcapng format.
- dpdk-dumpcap captures packets like wireshark and runs as a dpdk
  secondary process and writes to pcapng format files. dpdk-testpmd
  can be used to initialize the packet capture framework and acts as
  a server, whereas dpdk-dumpcap acts as a client.
  
- application command-line options must be separation from the EAL
  options with "--"
  - https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/testpmd_app_ug/run_app.html
  
- testpmd command-line options:
  - -i : interactive mode with a prompt
  - 

- IMPORTANT!!!!!!
  - For best performance on intel platforms, consider doing the following:
    - Reserve 1GB hugepages (default_hugepagesz=1G hugepagesz=1G hugepages=8)
    - Isolate CPU cores which will be used for DPDK (isolcpus=2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
    - If using vfio, (iommu=pt intel_iommu=on)
  - https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.html
  
- SHOULD YOU USE AVX WITH DPDK?

NO VFIO BINDING WITH MELLANOX CARDS!!!!!!
