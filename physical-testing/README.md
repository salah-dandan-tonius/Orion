# Physical Server Testing - Complete Documentation

## Executive Summary
Extended Salah's Orion packet capture framework from VM environment to physical blade servers with 10G networking. Achieved 0% packet loss at 10k pps with all three capture tools (tcpdump, PF_RING, netsniff-ng).

## 1. Infrastructure Changes

### Original Setup (Salah's VM):
- Virtual Machine environment
- Wireless interface (wlo1) 
- Limited bandwidth (VM constraints)
- Storage: /var/pcaps

### Physical Server Setup (Our Addition):
- Dell PowerEdge M620 blade servers
- Intel Xeon E5-2665 @ 2.40GHz (32 cores each)
- 128GB DDR3 RAM
- Intel 82599ES 10-Gigabit NIC
- Direct 10G link: dev01 (192.168.27.1) <-> dev02 (192.168.27.2)
- Interface: enp4s0f1 (changed from wlo1)
- MTU: 9000 (jumbo frames enabled)
- Storage: /srv/darknet-testing (90GB available)

## 2. Software Installation Commands

### On dev01 (Capture Server):
# Package installation
apt install tcpdump netsniff-ng xdp-tools libbpf-dev
apt install linux-headers-6.1.0-38-amd64
apt install bison flex libnl-genl-3-dev bc

# PF_RING rebuild for kernel 6.1.0-38
cd /opt/PF_RING/kernel
make clean
make
make install
modprobe pf_ring min_num_slots=65536 enable_tx_capture=0
On dev02 (Traffic Generator):
apt install tcpreplay
Network Configuration (Both Servers):
sudo ip link set dev enp4s0f1 mtu 9000

4. How to Run Tests
Step 1: On dev01 (Capture)
sudo /srv/darknet-testing/scripts/physical_capture.sh
# Select speed: 1=10k, 2=100k, 3=500k, 4=1M pps
Step 2: On dev02 (Traffic)
sudo /srv/darknet-testing/scripts/physical_traffic_gen.sh
# Select same speed as dev01
Step 3: Analyze Results
sudo /srv/darknet-testing/scripts/analyze_results.sh

6. Key Findings

All tools achieved 0% packet loss at 10k pps
Physical servers easily handle rates that crash VMs
MTU warnings during tcpreplay are normal (98% success rate)
Standard tcpdump captured most packets consistently

7. Problems Solved

GLIBC version mismatch with pre-compiled binaries
Storage constraints (moved from /home to /srv)
MTU issues with jumbo frames
Missing dependencies (bc, bison, flex, libnl-genl-3-dev)
PF_RING kernel module compatibility

8. Known Issues

Some packets > 9000 bytes cause "Message too long" errors
PF_RING tcpdump sometimes doesn't respond to timeout signals
~2% packet loss on tcpreplay due to oversized packets

9. Next Steps

Test at 100k, 500k, 1M pps to find breaking points
Compare CPU/memory usage across tools
Document performance differences vs VM environment
Test with different packet sizes
